<h3>PAST</h3>
  <p>
    I was born on <b> November 3rd, 2004</b>. I was born to my mom, Itoji Kawasaki-Combs, and my dad, Bill Combs, as well as born with my sister Mia. 
  <p>
    I was born here is Chicago at Illinois Masonic Medical Center in Lakeview. My ethnic makeup ranges from a couple Northern European countries and also includes Japanese. I am half Japanese because of my mother who is full. My dad's side includes at least a 1/16 Irish, English, and French. I believe that I am slightly more German and possibly a bit Swedish. It gets a bit complicated on my dad's side rather than my mom's because my mom's parents were obviously also both Japanese, and dad's dad gives me the at least 1/16 Irsh, English, French, and German. However, my grandma was adopted, so a lot of her ethnic makeup is unknown. I do remember from a chromosome test she sent us that I was part German and very Northern European, possibly Swedish.
  <p> 
    I have lived in the same house for all of my life up in Albany Park. I went to pre-school at Waters Elementary School before I transfered to the options program at Coonley Elementary School. 
  <p> 
    I think that one of my favorite vacations as a kid was one that I first took to go see my family in Japan. It was the first time that I had ever traveled outside of the country and there were so many amazing sites to see there. We visited so many temples and had a lot of fun there, as well as that my mom got to be home, which she doesn't get to really do often since it's not as though we live next door.
<br> <!--This is the end of the information that I had about my past and the sort of foundations of my life. You'll notice that also for the rest of the information sections I used quite a few paragraph (p) tags to space out my information I provided on there.-->

<h3>PRESENT</h3>
  <p>
    I spent up to 6th grade at Coonley. I transfered this year to Whitney M. Young Magnet High School as one of their incoming Academic Center students.  I came to this school with my sister, so I wasn't really alone. The irony of that was that they literally diced up our schedules so that we have no classes with each other excet for the occasional advisory, which at first appeared a bit deliberate but we still see each other around.
  <p>
    In 5th grade, I started running cross country and I ran for this school in the fall. I also joined Book Club, as well as Poetry Slam. I love getting to write poetry with a social message behind it and it is always great for me to be able to think creatively out of bounds.
  <p> 
    If I were to describe myself with three adjectives, I would say curious, eloquent (I guess), and weird. I'm fairly interested in a lot of things, I practice my writing quite a bit and I try to improve my creative style with that when I have the time to, and I am also particularly weird; no real explanation for that, that's kind of who I am.
  <p>
    I think that my favorite subject of all time is Social Studies. I think that it gives you a significant chance to open up your general understanding of the world's functions and helps you better understand how history, civics, and other things repeat and show themselves throughout our society.

<h3>FUTURE</h3>
  <p>
    For some near future goals, I first of all want to get better at running events that I do during the fall and spring. I want to specifically improve for the upcoming track season to take off some time on my previous events, which will take some practicing I am willing to do. I want to be better to my environment and remember to always care about soemthing before me. I think that I often think that I am too busy for things and fall short on doing something more important than an assignment. I think that socially I would like to be able to get to know everybody in the clubs that I am in because that would help me improve socially as well as tacking onto to what my goal is emotionally.
  <p>
    I have not exactly put much thought into what I really want to do for my life in the future. For certain, I know that I want to go to a good college/university. I like the idea of going to U of C, because I like the idea of being close to home. I also like Stanford and Princeton.
  <p> 
    For a profession, I really want to do something to do with writing, as long as it is not a teacher. Believe me, I have had a ton of great teachers and I don't understand how they seem to stay sane because it appears to me that they are constantly busy and full of stuff to do. I respect their work ethic, but I can't do that myself. I think that if I were to do aything, I would love to be either a jounalist or a author. I would love to be able to research the world and get to work with my imagination all day.
